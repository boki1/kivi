<div id="first_note">
> âœ£ usually negate is used when substracting, so a straight-forward optimization would be to check whether addition follows and to directly perform subtraction (`sub`) if that is the case
</div>

<div id="second_note">
> `imul` and `idiv` are signed operations, so a straight-forward optimization would be to check whether the operands are unsigned and if that is the case, to perform their unsigned alternatives (`mul` and `div` respectively)
</div>

<div id="third_note">
> there is not modular division instruction, but `div` (and `idiv`) store the remainder as well so we can get it from there
</div>
