# The Kivi Programming Language

_Official assignment_

## Описание

The KIVI compiler is a compiler of the KIVI programming language. The KIVI
programming language is made on the ground of educational interest. It is a
dynamically typed interpretative procedure language from the C family languages.
It’s main constructions are conditional statements(if), loops (while) and functions.

## Technologies

```
➔ C++
```
## Methodology

```
➔ Branching flow: Git Flow
➔ Scrum-ish; Sprint: 1 week
➔ Mandatory weekly meetings
    ● 2 small meetings
        - 30 min
        - Purpose: check how does the work go; any problems?
    ● 1 big meeting
        - 1h - 1h 30 min
        - Purpose: to peruse the tasks from the previous week& create a plan for the next week
➔ Will alter in time if needed
```

## First milestone - Front end (first part)

```
1. Lexical analyzer
    ➔ breaks up the source program into constituent pieces(lexemes) and imposes a grammatical structure on them
    ➔ detects if the source program is lexically ill-formed
    ➔ initializes a symbol table
2. Syntactic analyzer
    ➔ analyzes a string of symbols and conforming to the rules of a context-free grammar
    ➔ detects if the source program is syntactically ill-formed
```

## Second milestone - Front end (second part)

```
1. Semantic analyzer
    ➔ adds semantic information to the parse tree and builds the symbol table.
    ➔ detects if the source program is semantically ill-formed
2. Intermediate representation
    ➔ transforms the abstract syntax tree into an intermediate code representation (three-address code)
```

## Third milestone - Back end

```
1. Residual assignments left from the previous milestone
2. Code generation
    ➔ translates intermediate representation to x86 assembly
3. Documentation
    ➔ Adding documentation in the Github wiki page of the project
```


## Optional

➔ Preprocessor\
➔ More Mathematical Operations\
➔ Code Optimization\
➔ Pointers
