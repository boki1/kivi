What is Kivi?
-----------------

Kivi is a **compiler** under active development. It has educational purposes only. Kivi is designed to process a (currently) simplified C-like language, classified as procedural imperative general purpose programming language.

Why is Kivi?
-----------------

Kivi is initially started as a *Software development* school project at ELSYS. The principle objectives for us, the creators, are to learn about the fundamental ideas and design principles associated with compiler and programming language design.

What is Kivi not?
-----------------

It is not intended as a _useful_ programming language in a real project.
Although Kivi has a lot of similarities to the C programming language, is not intended to be an alternative implementation of _any C compiler_.
